# Mask_RCNN
Mask R-CNN for object detection and instance segmentation on Keras and TensorFlow
<br />
This repo is forked from https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN for finishing HW4 of the Selected Topics in Visual Ricognition using DeepLearning course.
<br />
The original owner of the repo has finished the training and evaluation part.
And I add some functions that can make it more easily trained on the dataset of the HW4.
